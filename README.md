## ROS2 Best Practices, Conventions, and Tricks

*Note: This package only contains the general folder structure and the README.md template for now, but no files yet.*

Package containing best practices for ROS2 applied in the Planetary Robotics Laboratory. It is inspired by [this package from RSL](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/ros_best_practices).

Checkout their [Wiki](https://github.com/ethz-asl/ros_best_practices/wiki) for best practices in ROS1 which mostly apply to ROS2 as well.
